Welcome to TPL's documentation!
=====================================

The Tycho Image Processing Library gives a common interface to work with a
range of image processing algorithms. It provides a simple script interface to
allow composition of algorithms and functionality to compare and contrast
competing algorithms as well as study their parameter spaces. This is motivated
by the complexity of evaluating sometimes complex sets of control parameters
that are not initially intuative in their use and to reduce the time to
evaluate different algorithms across a wide range of test data.
